In Xemu i get a Microsoft visual C++ Library error. It is named: Expression offset &lt; dma_len.  I have no idea how to fix it. Help anyone?

Getting this error in Xemu. It's on the game Tiger woods PGA tour 2004. The app gives this error when i start a round of golf. Dont know what to do. It didnt before. It worked flawlessly before. Somebody told me to use a fresh qcow2 file. I did. It worked for a certain game mode once. But now now all game modes still dont work. So the issue is sadly still there. Any other ideas? What can i do? I'm not into coding, so i have no clue what kind of error this is.![error](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115530640/195019984-ca1a3613-7a88-449e-a8a9-956d403ba9d7.jpg)
I added a screenshot of the error.
